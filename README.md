# Bluetooth LED Strip control (with Google Assistant)

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="img/img0.jpg" />
</p>

This is a project that uses a **Raspberry Pi (RPI)** to control a Bluetooth LED strip via **Google Assistant**.
The script uses **Python** to control the LED strip with the RPI and to create an API to access the script's methods.
Also **IFTT** is used to create the Google Assistant <-> API requests.

## Intro and setup

The basic set-up of the project is:

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="img/img1.jpg" />
</p>

### LED strip reverse engineering
1. A LED strip with a Bluetooth controller.
2. A computer with ADB drivers installed.
3. A mobile phone with Android (and the official App of the LED strip).
4. An USB type C cable (or similar).
5. General knowledges of Wireshark and packet sniffing

### API Server
1. A RPI with Raspbian installed.
2. An IDE (Atom or similar).
3. General knowledges of Python and API operation.

### Google Assistant / IFTT
1. A Google account and an IFTT account.

## Sniffing Bluetooth packets and reverse engineering the commands
### Requirements


## Creating an API-REST service
### Requirements

## Google Assistant integration with the API-REST
### Requirements
After defining the API-REST methods, we need to set the IFTT services. IFTT refers to:

```
If This Then That (commonly known as IFTTT, /…™ft/) is a web-based service that allows users to create chains of conditional statements triggered by changes that occur within other web services such as Gmail, Facebook, Telegram, Instagram, Pinterest or Google Assistant
```

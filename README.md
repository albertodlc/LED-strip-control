# Bluetooth LED Strip control (with Google Assistant)

This is a project that uses a **Raspberry Pi (RPI)** to control a Bluetooth LED strip via **Google Assistant**.
The script uses **Python** to control the LED strip with the RPI and to create an API to access the script's methods.
Also **IFTT** is used to create the Google Assistant <-> API requests.

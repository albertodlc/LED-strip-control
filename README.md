# Bluetooth LED Strip control (with Google Assistant)

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="img/img0.jpg" />
</p>

This is a project that uses a **Raspberry Pi (RPI)** to control a Bluetooth LED strip via **Google Assistant**.
The script uses **Python** to control the LED strip with the RPI and to create an API to access the script's methods.
Also **IFTT** is used to create the Google Assistant <-> API requests.

## Intro and setup

The basic set-up of the project is:

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="img/img1.jpg" />
</p>

### LED strip reverse engineering
1. A LED strip with a Bluetooth controller.
2. A computer with ADB drivers installed.
3. A mobile phone with Android (and the official App of the LED strip).
4. An USB type C cable (or similar).
5. General knowledges of Wireshark and packet sniffing

### API Server
1. A RPI with Raspbian installed.
2. An IDE (Atom or similar).
3. General knowledges of Python and API operation.

### Google Assistant / IFTTT
1. A Google account and an IFTTT account.

## Sniffing Bluetooth packets and reverse engineering the commands
### Requirements


## Creating an API-REST service
### Requirements

## Google Assistant integration with the API-REST
### Requirements
After defining the **API-REST** methods, you need to configure a **Static IP** on your RPI, configure a **DDNS** service and configure **Port-forwarding** on your router's firewall.

In addition to that, you need to set the **IFTTT services**. IFTTT refers to:
> If This Then That (commonly known as IFTTT, /…™ft/) is a web-based service that allows users to create chains of conditional statements triggered by changes that occur within other web services such as Gmail, Facebook, Telegram, Instagram, Pinterest or Google Assistant.
> - Wikipedia

### DDNS configuration (DuckDNS)
1. Go to the [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) website and sign up with your Google account (or other via).
2. The web will redirect you to the administration panel, you need to enter a name for your domain and press "add domain". The **domain** and you **public IP** will be added below.

</p>

### Port-Forwarding configuration (depends on the router model)


### IFTTT Configuration
1. Go to [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) website and create a new account.
2. Click **create** a new **Applet**.
3. In the "If this" rectangle click **add** and search for **Google Assistant**, select it.

</p>

4. Choose "Say a simple phrase" as your trigger (you can choose other option depending of the project you are working on).
<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="img/img51.JPG" />
</p>

5. Now choose the phrase and other variations. For example "Turn my lamp on". And the response of the assistant. After that click "Create Trigger" and proceed.

</p>

6. In the "Then that" rectangle click **add** and search for **Webhooks**, select it.
7. Now select "Make a web request" and set "Method" to POST, "Content Type" should be text/plain and "Body" can be left blank. Finally set the URL to
```
http://ipaddressgoeshere/methodyouwanttocall
```
8. Create your action and choose Finish.
